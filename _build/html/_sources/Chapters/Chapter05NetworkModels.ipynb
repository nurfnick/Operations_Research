        "Network model is such a huge topic, it pretty much covers every concepts within the information and technology. One of the reasons why one must understand the concept of network model is because it helps to break down larger problems into smallers ones and split them into chunks so that they can be easilt managed.  They represent a framework for dividing up the tasks needed to implement a network. The basic features of  network model, such as optimization and modularity,  has always been a boon for large scale industries to small businessess which as continuouly helped them enhance and modify systems for a common cause.\n",

        "Overall, we were so fascinated by this topic and the idea of network science, we wanted to explore the diversity, history and culture of this model. This really got us going."
