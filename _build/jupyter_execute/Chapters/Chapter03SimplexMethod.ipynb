    ">Before we head into the topic Simplex Method, it's essential to know what is Simplex Method? It is a combination of two terms, simplex and method where simplex stands for simple/basic and method means a systematic procedure or technique to accomplish the goal. Basically, Simplex Method, here in operation research, is an approach to solve linear programming models simply by hands using various means such as slack variables, tableaus, and pivot variables as a motive to find the optimal solution of an optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    " >The Simplex Method can be defined as a method for entering inequalities into a matrix and the keys to row-reduce that matrix. This method  also is applicable to any number of independent variables , making graphing unnecessary(Todd O. P16). "

    ">For linear programming problems involving two variables, the graphical solution method is convenient. However, for problems involving more than two variables or problems involving a large number of constraints, it is better to use solution methods that are adaptable to computers which is developed by George Dantzig in 1946, known as simplex method. Looking at the history of development of Simplex Method, George Dantzig is found to be working on planning methods for the US Army Air Force during World War II using a desk calculator . That’s when, the simplex method is invented .\n",
    "\n",
    ">Dantzig’s simplex method should not be confused with the downhill simplex method(Spendely 1962, Nelder and Mead , 1965, Press et al.1992). The latter method solves an unconstrained  minimization problem in n dimensions by maintaining at each iteration  n+1 points that define a simplex. At each iteration , this simplex is updated by applying certain transformation to it so that it “rolls downhill” until it finds a minimum.\n",
