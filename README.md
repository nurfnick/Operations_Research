# Operations_Research
A repository for Operations Research class at ECU and an open source text book for the course in Operations Research!  
This text will utilize python and hopefully show you how to apply python to different operations research topics.
Updates to the text are always welcome.

## The Book
The book is located (here)[https://nurfnick.github.io/Operations_Research/Chapters/Introduction.html]

### Building The Book (How to recompile, a note to myself)
To build the book, I worked at the office using GitHub Desktop.  I compiled it from Anaconda command line with "jupyter-book build "C:\Users\njacob\OneDrive - East Central University\Documents\GitHub\Operations_Research""  Then I took the contents of the html directory and put them into docs.  Push that back up and your site should update.  The command might have to be "jupyter-book build --all "C:\Users\njacob\OneDrive - East Central University\Documents\GitHub\Operations_Research"" to get it to look at **all** of the files.
