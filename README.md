# Operations_Research
A repository for Operations Research class at ECU and a place to submit our chapters for creating an open source text book for the course!

Adding your chapter into the repository will require you to *fork* this repository and keep it up to date as changes happen.  When you are ready to contribute your work, you will create a *merge* request.  Please use the **student_submits** branch for this.
