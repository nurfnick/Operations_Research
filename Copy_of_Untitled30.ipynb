        "\n",
        "The Monte Carlo Method was devised by Stanislaw Ulam during World War II. Ulam was a Polish mathematician who greatly contributed to the development of the hydrogen bomb. Ulam also contributed to the Manhattan Project, which was developing nuclear weapons during WWII.\n",
        "\n",
        "As they were finishing up the project, Stanislaw Ulam became afflicted with a viral encephalitis that caused him to go into a coma. While he was recovering from this potentially brain-damaging virus, Ulam frequently played the game of Solitaire. He wanted to deduce the probability of him winning a game, so he played the game hundreds of times and documented his results. This was the first step towards the creation of the Monte Carlo Simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stanislaw Ulam realized that the existence of computers made such statistical methods incredibly practical. He then took his idea to his coworker and boss, John von Neumann, who recognized the significance in his discovery. They both proceeded to develop the idea further until they created the simulation that is now used widely in computational sciences. The Monte Carlo Method is based on chance and probability, which is connected to gambling. They named it after the giant gambling Capital city in Europe, Monaco.\n",

        "The Monte Carlo Method is designed to make predictions that take every imaginable factor into account and display every possible outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is an effective means to portray the impact of risk and uncertainty when it comes to making decisions. Because we all make decisions and take risks every day, Monte Carlo is wildly popular among a plethora of different fields. This includes Astronomy, Climate Change, Engineering Financing, Weather, various scientific fields, and so much more. It is a safe bet to assume that any career path that involves making decisions will utilize Monte Carlo in some capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because we all face ambiguity and variability in our lives, using Monte Carlo simulations is a surefire way to allow for better decision making in the face of absolute uncertainty."
